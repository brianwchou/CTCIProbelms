    1.5 One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: 
    insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings 
    write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero) edits away.
    Example:
    pale, ple -> true
    pales, pale -> true
    pale, bale -> true
    pale, bake -> true
    pale, bake -> false
